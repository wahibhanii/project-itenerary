## About "**itinerary**"
"**itinerary**" is a place where people can share their travel experience.
There are two types of user: 
* Users who travelled

### Users who travelled 
This type of users may and and also encouraged to share their past travel **iteneraries** and stories that describes items such as:  
* Travel schedule
* Route
* Transportation
* Accomodation
* Activities
* Travel budget and costs
* Experience they were having

These items are combined into a travel **itinerary**.

### Users who want to travel
This type of users may look into 'Users who travelled'  and pick what kind of travel **itinerary** that suits them. There will be feature like _pick/follow_, copy, favorite, comment or discussion section for the **iteneraries**
